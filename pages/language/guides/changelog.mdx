## [1.1.0] - 2023-04-19

### ⚡️ Breaking changes

- `reply` is now a method of `Contract` instead of global context and changed its behavior if the storage reserve is non-zero in the contract.
- Logical expressions are now calculated differently: `&&` now does not execute the right expression if the left is `false` and `||` does not execute the right expression if the left is `true`. Before it was executed in any case. This change is made in an attempt to reduce unexpected behavior.
- `OwnableTransferable` now sends a response to the sender.
- `overwrites` was renamed to `override`
- `Deployable` trait now sends non-bounceable notifications instead of bounceable ones.

### Features

- `Address` to `Address` maps
- Ability to define key and value serializations for maps
- `sha256` hashing
- `forward` and `notify` functions that can be used to send messages to other contracts using the remaining value of the incoming message
- `virtual` and `abstract` constants that can be shared between traits
- `storageReserve` constant in every contract that can be used to reserve some storage space by any trait
- `abstract` functions that can be implemented in contracts
- `FactoryDeployable` trait for deploying from factory contract
- `@stdlib/dns` for easier DNS resolution
- Opt-in `external` message support
- Typed `bounce` receiver and `bounce<T>` type modifier
- `commit` for committing state changes
- `inline` modifier for functions for inlining them into the caller
- Ability to define empty messages (but not structs)
- Some string-related operations are now computed at compile time if possible

### Fixed

- Signature of `preloadBits` function
- Fixed `readForwardFee` function

## [1.0.0] - 2023-03-08

### Added

- Contracts now can be deployed only to the basic workchain unless `masterchain` set `true`
- Checking field initialization in the init function

### Fixed
